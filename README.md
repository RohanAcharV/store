The Offline Store Management project is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and automate the operations of a physical retail store, similar to a supermarket. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL, the project offers a range of essential features. It enables the store owner to monitor and analyze total sales and profits through intuitive visualizations presented in pie charts. The system provides detailed insights into individual product categories, including the quantity of products sold, remaining stock, and the profit gained. Additionally, the project offers daily and monthly reports to track sales performance over time. Store management tasks such as adding stocks and new items are seamlessly handled within the system. It also provides the functionality to store customer information and generate bills, facilitating smooth checkout processes. The ability to add products to a cart and print bills further enhances the overall shopping experience. With its user-friendly interface and robust functionality, the Offline Store Management project empowers store owners to efficiently manage inventory, track sales, and provide exceptional customer service.
